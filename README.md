# Project Sorpresa

Suprise! You can use this tool to validate whether a particular EDR Alert URL (Using the alert data) should have matched or failed a specific Suppression Rule.

The suppression rule can come from visiting the suppression rule in the EDR UI with the Network tab of the DevTools (F12) open. You need to get the response of the latestVersion request and paste it in the box. 

_Will_ display all matches and will show failure if one mismatch is detected.

THE EYE OF THE MIDNIGHT SUN CAN CONFIRM OR DENY WHETHER A RULE MATCHES AN ALERT :P
